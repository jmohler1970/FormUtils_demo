# FormUtils_demo
Demo of FormUtils functionality


## Getting Started with CommandBox

No need to download Adobe ColdFusion or Lucee. Commandbox does it all automatically

Get Ortus Solutions [Commandbox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox) The downloads are at the bottom of the page

Download this repository to favorite directory.

* On MacOS, my favorite is `~/Sites/ColdFusion/FormUtils_demo`
* On Windows, my favorite is `C:\Users\[username]\Documents\Sites\ColdFusion\FormUtils_demo`

In a terminal window, navigate to the appropriate directory

Type `box` <enter>

Type `start` <enter>

index.cfm automatically starts.

It is really that easy. This is why I recommend CommandBox


## Getting Started without CommandBox

Download this repository to subdirectory off off in the webroot.

Navigate to subdirectory

index.cfm may or may not show up depending on your webserver settings.
